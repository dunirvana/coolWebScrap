# coolWebScrap

Hello this is my API to fetch the last post of my blog ðŸ¥³ ( it's published [here](https://cool-web-scrap.vercel.app/) )

The goal here is to scrape the blog to take the last post and offer endpoints to retrieve the title of the last post as an image as well as an endpoint that redirects to that post

- /programero-last-post
- /programero-last-post-image
- /programero-last-post-url
